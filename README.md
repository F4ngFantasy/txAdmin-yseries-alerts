# txAdmin-yseries-alerts

## Credits
Creator credits go to Mr Cheesus Crust and Masterfirewall. And a massivbe thanks for allowing me to edit and upload this code (y'all are awesome for this guys)

## Details
This is a singular file that you can put in your yseries folder to replace the function of txAdmin, being those pesky alert bubbles at the top of your screen. The file has 2 primary functions:
- Replace the server restart announcement to be a city wide broadcast (mine is a stormchasers alert :P)
- Replace the alerts to be City Broadcasts

## Installation
First, on your txAdmin page on whatever browser you use (better be something that ain't edge fools), go to settings, then Restarter.

Next go to the 'Scheduled Restarts' box and set the times you want the server to auto restart. 
Then go to the Game settings, and down the bottom you will see a 'Hide Scheduled Restart Warnings' toggle. make sure it looks like this.

Do the same for 'Hide Announcement Notification'.
That is the default alerts disabled!
Next, go to this folder: yseries > server > custom > functions, drag the txAdmin_alerts.lua file into here. Then that is it! You are welcome to edit it as you see fit.
